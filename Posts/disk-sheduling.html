                Problem overview
            </h2>
            <h2 class='section-content'>In Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), data is stored on spinning disks. To access data,
                the disk arm moves to the right track.
                Since this movement takes time, disk scheduling is needed to decide the order of pending read/write
                requests, aiming to
                reduce total seek time.
                <br> <br>
                I've made a simple simulation of disk scheduling in Java. You can find the code in my GitHub repository
                <span id='demo' class='link'>here</span>.

                problem introduction
            </h2>
            <h2 class='section-content'>
                First, let's define what we will consider a disk. For us, a disk is a linearly ordered sequence of
                blocks.
                Processes can be executed from a specific place in memory, and for our simulation, this will simply be a
                position in the
                sequence of blocks – a specific block.
                <br><br>
                For the disk head – the part that reads and writes data – we define different movement algorithms. We
                define them, of
                course, in the context of the processes that appear on the disk. Moving to the next block takes one unit
                of time.
                <br><br>
                So, processes appear at specific locations on the disk, and we need to create an algorithm that will
                execute them as
                quickly as possible. In this article, I will present several algorithms that are used in real hard disk
                drives.
                It is worth noting that for SSDs, such algorithms are not needed, because they do not have a head, and
                access to data is
                practically instantaneous. For such disks, we use different solutions – HIOS.
                <br><br>
                Later we will discuss how to handle processes which have some deadlines!

                Criteria for disk scheduling algorithms
            </h2>
            <h2 class="section-content">
                There are several criteria for evaluating disk scheduling algorithms. The most important ones are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Moves of disk arm: amount of moves that arm will make.</li>
                    <li>Average waiting times for processes: average waiting time that process needs to wait for arm to
                        arrive.
                    </li>
                    <li>Starved processes: amount of processes that waited too long.</li>
                    <li>Killed processes: amount of processes that exceeded deadline and were not processes in time.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">
                Let's talk about algorithms
            </h2>
            <h2 class="section-content" style="font-weight: 600;">FCFS</h2>
            <h2 class="section-content">
                First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) is the simplest disk scheduling algorithm. It processes requests in the
                order they arrive. The disk head moves to the requested block, executes the process, and then moves to
                the next request. This algorithm is easy to implement but can lead to long wait times, especially if a
                request is far from the current position of the disk head.
                <br>
                Let's see how would such algorithm work on our disk:

            </div>

            <h2 class="section-content" style="font-weight: 600;">SSTF</h2>
            <h2 class="section-content">
                Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) is a more efficient algorithm than FCFS. It selects the request that is
                closest to the current position of the disk head. This reduces the average wait time for processes, but
                it can lead to starvation for requests that are far from the current position of the disk head.
                It can also lead to a situation where the disk head moves back and forth between two requests, causing
                unnecessary delays and starvation for other requests.
                <br>
                It also read all processes in the way, so while travelling to the closest one, it will read all
                processes
                in the way.
                <br>
                Let's see how would such algorithm work on our disk:

            <h2 class="section-content" style="font-weight: 600;">Scan</h2>
            <h2 class="section-content">
                Scan is a more advanced algorithm that moves the disk head in one direction until it reaches the end of
                the disk, then reverses direction and processes requests in the opposite direction. This algorithm is
                more efficient than FCFS and SSTF, as it reduces the average wait time for processes and prevents
                starvation. However, it can still lead to long wait times for requests that are far from the current
                position of the disk head.

            <h2 class="section-content" style="font-weight: 600;">C-Scan</h2>
            <h2 class="section-content">
                C-Scan (Circular Scan) is a variation of the Scan algorithm. It moves the disk head in one direction
                until it reaches the end of the disk, then jumps back to the beginning and continues processing requests
                in the same direction. This algorithm is more efficient than Scan, as it reduces the average wait time
                for
                processes and prevents starvation. However, it can still lead to long wait times for requests that are
                far
                from the current position of the disk head.

                also generate processes for each algorithm separately, and we will take into account
                that arm position will be different for each algorithm.

                executed in time, it is killed. We can introduce a new parameter - deadline. It is a time when process
                must be executed. Those processes will be colored to red and disappear if killed or executed.

                Real time processes algorithms are similar to those for normal processes. Even more,
                they use as "wrapper" - if there are no processes with deadline we use normal algorithm,
                if there is we use special algorithm for real time processes.
                <br> <br>
                We have 2 main algorithms that I will discuss here:
            </h2>

            <h2 class="section-content" style="font-weight: 600;">
                EDF
            </h2>

            <h2 class="section-content">
                Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is a real-time scheduling algorithm that selects the request with the
                earliest deadline. This algorithm is more efficient than FCFS and SSTF, as it reduces the average wait
                time for processes and prevents starvation. However, it can still lead to long wait times for requests
                that are far from the current position of the disk head.
                <br><br>
                However we have no guarantee that we will be able to execute all processes in time.
                <br>
                We do not execute processes in way.

            <h2 class="section-content" style="font-weight: 600;">
                FD-Scan
            </h2>
            <h2 class="section-content">
                FD-Scan (Fixed Deadline Scan) is a variation of the Scan algorithm. It moves the disk head in one
                direction until it reaches the end of the disk, then reverses direction and processes requests in the
                opposite direction. This algorithm is more efficient than FCFS and SSTF, as it reduces the average wait
                time for processes and prevents starvation. However, it can still lead to long wait times for requests
                that are far from the current position of the disk head.
                <br>
                Because of being Scan algorithm it also executes all processes in the way.

                Let's see how would such algorithm work on our disk - we will test them on FCFS, as
                it is the worst algorithm for real time processes:

            <h2 class="section-content">
                It's clear that FCFS with FD-Scan is the best algorithm for real time processes. <br>
                Because of no guarantee of executing processes in time and not executing processes in
                the way FCFS with EDF is the worst algorithm for real time processes, close to normal FCFS.

            <h2 class="section-content">
                In conclusion, disk scheduling algorithms play a crucial role in optimizing the performance of
                traditional HDDs by minimizing seek time and improving overall efficiency. While algorithms like FCFS
                are simple to implement, they often fall short in terms of performance compared to more advanced
                algorithms like SSTF, Scan, and C-Scan. Real-time processes introduce additional complexity, requiring
                specialized algorithms like EDF and FD-Scan to handle deadlines effectively.

                Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm is essential for selecting the right
                approach based on specific use cases. As technology evolves and SSDs become more prevalent, the need for
                such algorithms may diminish, but their principles remain valuable for understanding how storage systems
                operate.

                Thank you for reading, and I hope this article provided valuable insights into the fascinating world of
                disk scheduling!
