                Why did I decide to rebuild my website?
            </h2>
            <h2 class="section-content">
                I decided to rebuild my site because the old design no longer reflected my current skillsâ€”it was created
                back when I was
                just learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Plus, I wanted to test out my new MacBook and get a fresh,
                updated site ready
                before starting university. Most importantly, it was a great opportunity to continue learning and
                refining my
                development skills.

            </div>

            <h2 class="section-content">
                The homepage has changed a lot. I wanted to achieve a more minimalist look for the site, with a slightly
                more modern
                design. I didn't like the "blocky" look of the old design and disliked the colors. I managed to choose a
                great,
                minimalist brownish color palette that I love. It became clear that sometimes "less" content is better,
                not only in
                terms of design and aesthetics but also for improved readability.

            </div>

            <h2 class="section-content">
                The old design of the "All Posts" page looked terrible. There was too much content on the screen, most
                of which was
                useless for the user. I decided to make it more minimalist and readable, and I was really amazed by how
                it turned out. I
                improved not only the look but also the readability. The color palette now matches the rest of the
                site's colors. I also
                added a navbar, which is an essential part of my site, and ensured the overall design remained
                consistent with the rest
                of the page.

            <h2 class="section-content">
                The look of the posts didn't change much, as it was the most recent element. I updated the color
                palette, adjusted some
                font sizes, and added a maximum width for images.
                Also I centered post content on site and made it to
                not cover whole page on bigger screens.

                I'm quite proud to say that I didn't use any frameworks for my site. It's 100% handmade, from the post
                system to the
                entire design. It was a great experience for me to challenge myself and improve my web design skills.

            <h2 class="section-content">
                I always wanted to have a blog section on my personal site. I didn't like that everyone uses frameworks
                like Blowfish.
                There's nothing wrong with that, but I have a scientific mindset, and I love to invent and create my own
                things. So, I
                did the same here! I created my own post system â€” maybe a bit unusual, maybe not so fancy, but hey! It's
                mine!

            <h2 class="section-content">
                I didn't want to host anything on external clouds. I wanted to build the post system entirely on GitHub.
                So, I thought
                maybe there was a way to run Python on GitHub remotely â€” and there is! I created a GitHub workflow
                script
                that checks for
                any changes in the <i class="scr">Posts/</i> directory. If changes are detected, it runs a simple
                <i class="scr">posts_handler.py</i> script.
                This script
                retrieves all files with the <i class='scr'>.html</i> extension in the <i class="scr">Posts/</i>
                directory and adds their
                paths to <i class="scr">posts.json</i>,
                which contains
                all the posts. When any page containing posts is loaded, it fetches the post data and displays it. All
                posts follow the
                same format, so processing them is straightforward. Pure JavaScript couldn't check directories on the
                site or retrieve
                all the files from <i class="scr">Posts/</i> because it's website-based. That's why we needed Python!

                I started by looking for inspiration online. I visited some sites hosted by other developers to see how
                they built their
                personal sites. I noticed that I prefer a minimalist look over some modern sites with a lot of content.
                Then I chose a
                color palette using <u class="quicklink" id="coolors">Coolors</u> (a site for picking color palettes,
                you can see the palette I used <u class="quicklink" id="palette">here</u>).
                After that, I
                began the redesign. It took a long time to implement all the changes, but it was worth it. Here, you can
                see some
                progress I documented for the redesign of the "All Posts" page.

                Rebuilding my personal site has been a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience. From redesigning
                the layout to
                building a custom post system, I've learned so much along the way. The process pushed me to refine my
                skills, experiment
                with new ideas, and make something that truly reflects my vision. Iâ€™m proud of the final result, and I
                hope it showcases
                not just my technical abilities but also my personal style. This site will continue to evolve, and I
                look forward to
                adding even more features and improvements in the future. Thanks for following along with the journey!
