            <h2 class='section-content'>The Doppler Effect, named after the
                Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, is a
                phenomenon in physics that
                describes the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in
                relation to an observer moving relative to
                the
                source of the wave. In simpler terms, it explains why the
                sound or light from a moving object appears
                different to an observer compared to when the object is
                stationary.

                problem introduction
            </h2>
            <h2 class='section-content'>
                Looking at the gifs you can clearly see that
                observer "touches" waves with diffrent frequency.
                From these gifs it's also clearly seen that frequency
                depends on velocity of source and observer. It's
                important to note that we'll discuss only movement
                on the same axis (that means you can create
                displacement vector which always has the same direction).

                Let's talk about what happens when observer is moving:

                </div>
            </div>
            <h2 class='section-content'>
                As we can see if observer is moving toward source,
                frequency is less than original one. When is moving away
                frequency
                is greater than original one. When observer is
                moving toward source, it is "crashing" with waves,
                but when is moving away, it is running away of them.
                The equations for an observer moving toward or away from a
                stationary source can be combined into one equation:
                <br>
                $$f_{o} = {V \pm V_{o} \over V}$$
                <br>
                where f<sub>o</sub> is observed frequency, f<sub>s</sub> is source'
                frequency, v is velocity of the wave and v<sub>o</sub> is velocity of
                observer.
                <br>
                If observer is moving toward source, we're adding velocity, because
                frequency then is larger than original.
                <br>
                If observer is moving away of source, we're subtracting velocity, because
                frequency then is less than original.

                You can observe doppler effect everyday. Most common example is
                passing car with some signal (honk, sirens or radio). You will note
                that you hear diffrent sound when it is closer to you and when it is
                approaching you.
                <br>
                Some radars uses doppler effect to detect objects. Objects simply bounces
                wave signal back which is detected then.
